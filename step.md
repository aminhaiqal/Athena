Step 1: Add Context-Aware Q&A (Mini RAG)
Ask questions about the legislative text or summary.

Example:
“What is this bill trying to solve?”

“Who might be affected by this?”

How:
Store full law texts

Use text-embedding-3-small (or similar) to embed them

Store in a simple vector store like ChromaDB

When a user asks a question:)

Query:

user_question → search vector store → feed top chunks + user query into ChatGPT

Output: A working question-answer feature, helpful for policy pros.

Step 2: Add Source-Aware Alerts
“Alert me when a new law is published that matches keywords: digital tax, startup, data privacy.”

How:
Store user preferences or keyword triggers

When new data is scraped:

Match keywords → generate alert message

Optionally: summarize the new entry before sending

Output: Users feel informed without digging through noise.

Step 3: Agent that Monitors and Reports
Weekly report: “Here are the 3 most important changes in Energy Policy this week.”

How:
Agent runs every week (cron job)

Filters by category or keywords

Summarizes changes + links them

Sends report to user via email/PDF/dashboard

Output: Now you have a real AI assistant, not just summaries.

Step 4 (Optional): Stakeholder Matching (if you have names & bios)
“This new bill affects these 4 stakeholders you follow.”

How:

Embed both the law + stakeholder descriptions

Use cosine similarity to detect relevant matches

Show on dashboard or send via email
